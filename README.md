# copier-python-template

This repository is a migration from the original cookiecutter-based template https://github.com/NLeSC/python-template to copier.
Motivation: 
- Code lifecycle management (when the template evolves, users can update their projects);
- Keep statistics of the number of users.

Also refer to [this](https://github.com/NLeSC/python-template/issues/348) issue.

## Quickstart

To generate a project from the template:
```
pip install copier
copier copy path/to/project/template path/to/destination
```
